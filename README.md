# Linux-Init
A script to set and install basic things that I need for a new linux setup. Uses my name and email address for git configuration, obviously needs to be changed if used by someone else.

Uses apt-get and installs two Ubuntu-specific tools, so it's not going to work 100% with other distros. If something cannot be installed/executed, it prints out an error message, but keeps running.
